Here is a Python class that inherits from the `IngestClass` and implements the `parser` function to detect CWE327_Use_Broken_Crypto vulnerabilities in C code. The function uses string parsing, regex, and other Python techniques to identify the vulnerabilities.

```python
import re

class CWE327Parser(IngestClass):

    def parser(self, code):
        # Initialize a variable to store the result
        result = False

        # Use regex to find function calls related to broken cryptography
        # The regular expression pattern matches function calls with specific names
        # that are known to be vulnerable to CWE327_Use_Broken_Crypto
        pattern = re.compile(r'CWE327_Use_Broken_Crypto__w32_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+')

        # Find all matches of the pattern in the code
        matches = pattern.findall(code)

        # If any matches are found, set the result to True
        if matches:
            result = True

        return result
```

This code defines a class `CWE327Parser` that inherits from the `IngestClass`. The `parser` function searches for function calls related to broken cryptography using regular expressions. If any matches are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the CWE327_Use_Broken_Crypto vulnerability is present. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
