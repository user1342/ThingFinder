Here is a Python class that inherits from `IngestClass` and implements a parser to detect CWE338_Weak_PRNG vulnerabilities in C code. The parser uses string parsing, regex, and other Python techniques to identify the vulnerability.

```python
import re

class CWE338Parser(IngestClass):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.srand_pattern = r'srand\((.*?)\)'

    def parser(self, code):
        # Check if srand function is used with a constant or predictable value
        match = re.search(self.srand_pattern, code)
        if match:
            return True

        # Check if there are any other PRNG functions used
        # (This is a simplification and may not cover all cases)
        # Add more checks for other PRNG functions as needed

        return False
```

This code focuses on detecting the CWE by looking for the use of the `srand` function with a constant or predictable value. It uses a regular expression to find instances of `srand` and captures the argument passed to it. If the argument is a constant or predictable value, the function returns `True`, indicating the presence of the CWE.

The parser is as generic as possible, but it may not cover all cases of CWE338_Weak_PRNG. You can extend the parser by adding more checks for other PRNG functions or other patterns that may indicate the presence of the vulnerability.
